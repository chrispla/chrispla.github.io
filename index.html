										<h2>About</h2>
										<p>I am currently an undergraduate student at New York University Abu Dhabi, majoring in Co I have been exploring music through both a scientific and an artistic lens.\n\n    Ever since my journey at New York University started, I have been fortunate to explore my passions further. I have been studying in Abu Dhabi, Paris and New York, in cool places such as IRCAM, École Cortot, and NYU's Music, Science and Engineering Departments. I am currently an undergraduate student at New York University Abu Dhabi, majoring in Computer Science and Music. Things I am currently working on surround areas such as audio signal processing, optical music recognition, computational musicology, machine learning, information theory, mathematical logic, contemporary composition inluding classical and electronic, and piano performance. Below, you can read a short overview of my journey.\n\n   I was born and raised in Athens, Greece. At the age of 3, I started my first music classes in the Philippos Nakas Conservatory. After receiving diplomas for Autorgan (keyboard) and Electone (electronic organ) at the age of 8, I started having classical piano and music theory classes. During this period I started composing my own music. At the age of 11, I decided to continue my music education with Sami Amiris, one of the most well-known jazz pianists in Greece. Amiris played an important role in the development of my love for mathematics, programming, and music. Ever since then, I have been exploring music through both a scientific and an artistic lens.\n\n    Ever since my journey at New York University started, I have been fortunate to explore my passions further. I have been studying in Abu Dhabi, Paris and New York, in cool places such as IRCAM, École Cortot, and NYU's Music, Science and Engineering Departments.</p>

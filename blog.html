							<h3>Is work part of the plan for happiness?</h2>
							<h5>Reflection 1 - January 17th, 2022</h5>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> In one's strive for happiness there often comes the realization that one can never become happy. One can only be happy. In my own quest of attempting to recognize the moments I am trying to pursue happiness instead of seeing it, I stumbled upon a seemingly obvious omission. What about work? Is it fine that I am allowing my personal projects, my job, or my studies to affect my mood, positively and, more interestingly, negatively? Is work another playing field for the chase of pleasure?</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> I don't really consider my life to inherently have a meaning, or at least there's no meaning that I know of that I would want to identify with. I love making things that people find utility or pleasure in, whether that's software or music. But I can't say my life's goal is to maximize my contribution to the world, neither can I find much interest in the idea of fulfilling my potential.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Is work for the personal gains? Given I assign no higher meaning to it, is it reducible to the money and recognition it can produce? If that's the case, how should I think of the emotions that arise when working or thinking about work? Above a hypothetical monetary threshold required to live a mentally and physically healthy life, one could argue that, if work is about its output, I am again involved in a chase of pleasure, this time through money and recognition. My work-related affective state is merely its byproduct.</p>
							<p style="text-indent: 2em;"> But what if work is for itself, and not its results? And if this is the case, why is it often accompanied by negative emotions? It seems to me that if I truly believe that I work because of my attitude towards the process of working, it is a worthy endeavor to investigate why negative emotions are sometimes arising when working or thinking about work. Should I only be striving to find and do work that gives me pleasure? Should I work to improve my concentration for a particular task until I start enjoying it? I am not sure...but I feel that the more I've avoided framing work as a chase, the better I've managed to define a healthier and, perhaps, happier relationship with it.</p>
